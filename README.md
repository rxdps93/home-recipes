# home-recipes
A simple API for my wife to access her recipes. Recipe/cooking websites are cesspools of javascript bloat and advertisements. This is a fun project for me and gives her a comfortable way to access her recipes.

I wanted to learn Go so this gives me an excuse to do so. I also intend on learning some frontend technologies I've been curious about, like HTMX, so that will be incorporated eventually. Down the road I will be flexing my electrical engineering muscles (that I don't actually have yet) and would like to attempt to build her a small e-ink device that is purpose built for accessing these recipes.
